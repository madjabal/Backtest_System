# Backtest_System
A collection of functions and files to run trading backtests on equities. 

This repo is currently a work in progress and future updates will include:
- An interface separate from a Jupyter Notebook
- Organization improvements
- Speed improvements

It currently supports various data manipulations and access provided by the yfinance package, 
high flexibility in capital allocation, and support for all SkLearn models.
